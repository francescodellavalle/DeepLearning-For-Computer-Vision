Image recognition is crucial in computer vision, as it involves recognizing and categorizing
objects, scenes, or patterns in digital images or video frames. Its significance resonates
across diverse real-world applications, spanning autonomous driving, medical diagnosis,
surveillance, and augmented reality.
The heart of image recognition lies in creating algorithms that can understand and interpret
the complex visual information contained within images. Traditional methodologies heavily
leaned on manually crafted features and shallow machine learning models, often grappling
with the complexities inherent in visual patterns and the variability introduced by lighting
conditions, viewpoints, and background clutter.
However, with the emergence of deep learning, particularly convolutional neural networks
(CNNs), substantial strides have been made in the domain of image recognition. By
traversing multiple layers of convolution, pooling, and non-linear transformations, CNNs
adeptly extract increasingly abstract features, thereby facilitating precise recognition of
objects and patterns depicted in images.
However, despite these remarkable advancements, image recognition still presents
significant challenges due to factors such as occlusions, variations in scale and orientation,
and the presence of multiple objects within a single scene
